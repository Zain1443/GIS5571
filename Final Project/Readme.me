Introduction to Project
Site selection is a key phase of the sitting process of any thermal power plant and may significantly affect the capital and generation cost during its entire life cycle. This study introduces a GIS-based protocol to locate optimal sites for combined cycle power plant installation, selecting Sindh province, Pakistan, as a case study. This analysis is based on different economic, technical, and environmental criteria such as proximity to the gas source, national grid and water source, road accessibility, safe distance from urban settlements, land cover, and site elevation.
